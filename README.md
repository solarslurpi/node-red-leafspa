# Intro
This is my first node-red app.  I am not sure if I will ultimately choose node-red for this project or eventually switch to a microcontroller / CircuitPython environment.  What I am finding is great about node-red is its ability to rapidly implement a design intent through a flow.  It is thrilling to work out a code flow - just as I would with a flow diagram - and then tweak as needed.  It has afforded rapid prototyping.  So for prototyping, I am really enjoying node-red.  However, tbe high level of abstraction provided by node-red - while very much appreciated for prototyping - might be too much for a deployed system.  When I want something to run consistently, I tend to want a much more simplified microcontroller environment.  So we will see.
